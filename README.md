# FunkinEmbed
this is just the HTML5 release of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin)

This is for me to use to embed in websites easily, but you can use it too if you want! 
The link is https://sebeldev.github.io/FunkinEmbed/

I did not make any assets, code, or files in this repository besides this README.md file, they were entirely made by the Funkin' Crew!
